# Learning Path
All material will be posted here

Learning seems to be an highly iterative process to me, it is quite often random to get along and wrap your head around new concepts, ideas in one go. So a learner shouldn’t get disheartened if some things come along in one go. 

Considering a person who has no background in Data Science or visualizing data other than basic of excel it is important to start the learning journey with some basic things in python. The first and most basic thing to begin with should be introduction to various data structures available in python. Since students already have some basic knowledge with coding(and that too in C) they are already equipped with list or matrices(just as 2D list) type data type(just my assumption). And dealing with these often goes through with the mindset of for loops which is just way old school and highly non-pythonic way of dealing things. So to start with the learner should get along with data structures such as :
- Dictionaries 
- Series
- Sets
- Data Frame 

After getting  some familiarity and coming out of mindset of looping and comfy with data structures it’s time to get into visualisations. Python has way too many options available for this but just learning tools here is just nothing rather why and what each visualisation describes is rather important. Interpreting the graphs and visualisation is the key. Some of the visualisations that can be learned are :
- Pivot tables
- Heatmaps 
- Basic bar,pie,etc. charts 
- Cohort analysis

Once these few basic concepts are clear the next hurdle to cross can be machine learning. Starting with machine learning it might not be very important to understand the maths and knitty-gritty details of everything that’s going on. One should start with understanding of algos and how each are different from each other. Highly excited and enthusiastic ones may dive into the maths as well which is always a plus, although most of the logics one might think of coding themselves have been sorted out by one line commands in python :P so take a chill pill and wrap the head around logic and ideas of algos before their maths. In python one should learn SciKit Learn for this.
